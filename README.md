# Text-To-Speech-Transformers

Dataset Used : LJ Speech Dataset (link is in the notebook)

We've done EDA and then some visualizations to understand our speech dataset. And then we have used various implementations and kinds of transformers for our text-to-speech synthesis. Go through our presentation in the repository for better understanding and also see the comments in the notebook.

Note : Due to limited time and computational power, The model was trained in a very constrained manner limiting it's performance. Kindly excuse me for that, Will be updating the repository or creating a new one when any significant progress is made. Training transformer models from scratch is resource consuming indeed.
