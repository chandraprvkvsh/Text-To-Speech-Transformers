# Text-To-Speech-Transformers

Welcome to the Text-To-Speech-Transformers repository! This project aims to explore various implementations and types of transformers for text-to-speech synthesis using the LJ Speech Dataset. Below, you'll find information on how to navigate this repository and an overview of the contents.

## Dataset Used
The LJ Speech Dataset was utilized for this project. You can find the link to the dataset in the notebook provided.

## Overview
In this repository, we've conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualizations to gain insights into the LJ Speech Dataset. Additionally, various transformer models have been implemented and experimented with for text-to-speech synthesis.

## Presentation and Notebook
For a comprehensive understanding of the project, we highly recommend going through our presentation included in the repository. Additionally, detailed comments have been added in the notebook to provide insights into the code and methodology.

## Note
Due to constraints such as limited time and computational resources, the model was trained under constrained conditions, which may impact its performance. We apologize for any inconvenience caused by this limitation. We plan to update the repository or create a new one when significant progress is made. Training transformer models from scratch is resource-intensive, and we appreciate your understanding.
